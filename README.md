# DuckPGQ

DuckPGQ is a DuckDB extension for graph workloads with support for SQL/PGQ.

For user documentation, examples, and background, see [duckpgq.org](https://duckpgq.org/).

## Status

DuckPGQ is a research project and a work in progress. Feedback, bug reports, and contributions are welcome.

This branch is migrating SQL/PGQ to DuckDB v2.0-cyanoptera's `GrammarExtension` framework. The first slice supports
`CREATE PROPERTY GRAPH` only; `GRAPH_TABLE`, `DROP`, `DESCRIBE`, and `SUMMARIZE PROPERTY GRAPH` still need to be ported.
See [the grammar migration notes](docs/GRAMMAR_EXTENSION.md) for activation, supported syntax, and focused tests.

## Installation

DuckPGQ is available as a DuckDB community extension:

```sql
INSTALL duckpgq FROM community;
LOAD duckpgq;
```

See the [DuckPGQ community extension page](https://community-extensions.duckdb.org/extensions/duckpgq.html) for package availability.

## Quick Example

```sql
SET active_grammar_extensions = ['duckpgq'];

CREATE TABLE Person(id BIGINT, name VARCHAR);
CREATE TABLE Person_knows_Person(person1id BIGINT, person2id BIGINT);

INSERT INTO Person VALUES
    (1, 'Alice'),
    (2, 'Bob');

INSERT INTO Person_knows_Person VALUES
    (1, 2);

CREATE PROPERTY GRAPH social
VERTEX TABLES (
    Person
)
EDGE TABLES (
    Person_knows_Person
        SOURCE KEY (person1id) REFERENCES Person (id)
        DESTINATION KEY (person2id) REFERENCES Person (id)
        LABEL Knows
);

-- Graph querying will return in a subsequent grammar migration slice.
```

## Building From Source

Initialize submodules before building:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Build the extension and the bundled DuckDB shell:

```sh
make release GEN=ninja
```

For a debug build:

```sh
make debug GEN=ninja
```

Build artifacts are written under `build/<build-type>/`:

| Artifact | Release path | Debug path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DuckDB shell | `build/release/duckdb` | `build/debug/duckdb` |
| Test runner | `build/release/test/unittest` | `build/debug/test/unittest` |
| Loadable extension | `build/release/extension/duckpgq/duckpgq.duckdb_extension` | `build/debug/extension/duckpgq/duckpgq.duckdb_extension` |

DuckPGQ uses the DuckDB extension build system. If dependency resolution fails, install and configure [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started), then set `VCPKG_TOOLCHAIN_PATH` to your vcpkg toolchain file.

## Running a Local Build

Start the locally built DuckDB shell:

```sh
./build/release/duckdb
```

The extension is linked into this shell.

Enable the SQL/PGQ grammar on each connection with `SET active_grammar_extensions = ['duckpgq'];`.

## Testing

Run the SQL test suite:

```sh
make test_release
```

During the create-only grammar migration, use the focused suite:

```sh
./build/release/test/unittest 'test/sql/grammar_extension/*'
```

The legacy suite includes syntax that has not yet been migrated, so it is not expected to pass in full on this branch.

Run a single SQL logic test:

```sh
make test T=test/sql/pattern_matching/undirected_edges.test
```

Run clang-tidy checks:

```sh
make tidy-check
```

## Repository Notes

- SQL tests live in `test/sql`.
- Extension source lives in `src`.
- Grammar integration lives under `src/core/parser` and extends DuckDB's native grammar without a vendored parser.
- Maintenance notes for updating DuckDB or parser dependencies are in [docs/UPDATING.md](docs/UPDATING.md).
